# Each of the following functions draws a specific block.
# Please visit this link for a description of the blocks:
#      https://i.gzn.jp/img/2019/11/16/tetris-algorithm/tetmino.png

# Each function is named after the block that it draws. It takes two arguments, both of which are optional because they have a default x and y value. The default value would draw it in the top right corner. Each function has a 3D list. In this list, are four 2D lists. Each of the four 2D lists are an orientation of the shape. For example, the first 2D list in the Z_block function would be the shape rotated 0 degrees. The second 2D list would be the shape rotated 90 degrees, etc. Each of the coordinates are relative to the singular x and y coordinate being drawn. Thus, when the function is called, it calculates all the possible rotational positions of the shape in the 3D list. It returns that list of rotational coordinates.
